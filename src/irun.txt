### The TractLSM can be used in several configurations, determined by a number
### of switches supplied to run the model. Therefore, this text file is a setup
### file equivalent to a LSM namelist.

# Throughout the file, 'None' or 'default' entries are the equivalent of
# commenting out the lines.
# When giving a file name, the absolute path is needed.


## 1. Site level runs

# The site can be set to match a meteorological forcing file for a specific
# site, e.g. 'Tumbarumba'. At a given site, a specific run year can be chosen.
# Alternatively, 'None' calls a weather generator which uses idealised
# meteorological forcing to run the model. In that case, the year must be set
# to 'None'.

site = EucFACER1
year = None


## 2. Specifications for the weather generator

# The weather generator should preferably be called upon when running an
# idealised experiment. Yet, a start day (e.g. doy = 1, i.e. Jan 1st) and a
# duration for the run (e.g. Nday = 1. runs for the start day only) have to be
# chosen. If the model is being run at site level, it does not matter what the
# doy and Ndays switches equate to.

doy = 1.
Ndays = 1.


## 3. Using a specific set of parameters

# Specific parameters should either be kept in a csv file (e.g. containing
# sites' info) or in a class within a python file (setup like the default
# parameters in TractLSM/Utils/).
# When importing the parameters from a python class, the import can differ
# depending on your machine. So you might have to modify the retrieve_class
# function in TractLSM/Utils/general_utils.py, which is not recommended.

params = default


## 4. Choosing the model configuration

# If you do not want to run the model for the full length of the timeseries
# (e.g., only running for the first 10 hours for testing purposes), you must
# specify the number of timesteps if must be run for. If no timestep number is
# specified, the full length of the timeseries is run.

Nsteps = None


# The models switch allows you to pick the C-H2O flux solver(s). If the switch
# is left unspecified (i.e., commented out or set to 'default'), the default
# configurations are run (i.e., both 'USO' and 'ProfitMax').
# Possible choices are: 'USO', 'ProfitMax'; any of those two configurations can
# be run alone.

models = ProfitMax


# The default model configuration runs a dynamic soil hydrology scheme.
# However, soil moisture can be included in the forcing file, and the model can
# be run with this driver by setting soilwater to 'prescribed'.

soilwater = default


# The Farquhar photosynthesis model is the default recommended photosynthesis
# model (i.e., 'default' is equivalent to 'Farquhar').
# The Collatz model can be run instead by choosing 'Collatz'.

photo = default


# The matricial optimisation solver runs at a relatively 'low' resolution, by
# default. When running the model over short timescales, it may be worth
# exploring the effects of running at 'med' or 'high' resolutions.

resolution = default


# Hydraulic legacies (e.g., temporary decrease in maximum hydraulic conductance
# due to drought, delayed recovery from embolism, etc.) are not accounted for
# by default, but can be every N days. For example, setting fhydralegs = 20
# computes hydraulic legacies every 20 days.

fhydralegs = 30


# By default, the maximum RuBP carboxylation transport rate at 25 degC (Vmax25)
# and the maximum electron transport rate at 25 degC (Jmax25) are kept constant.
# However, they can be made to vary by calling the optimal N leaf allocation
# module, which shuffles leaf N into different allocation pools every N days,
# with the aim to maximise future net C assimilation, depending on antecedent
# environmental conditions (over the previous N days). For example, fleafNopt
# set to 14 optimises Vmax25 and Jmax25 to maximise C uptake on a 14-day basis.

fleafNopt = 7


# The tag refers to the unique name associated with the model configuration of
# the run. By default, it is based on the models and options that have been
# called upon. For example, calling the default couplers, default photosynthetic
# model, a low resolution for the hydraulic stream, fhydralegs every 20 days,
# fleafNopt every 14 days, and setting Nsteps to 1000 will yield the tag:
# 'UP-F-Rlow-Leg20-JV14-N1000'
# However, any tag can be specified by the user.

tag = default


## 5. Generating default figures

# If plot is set to 'yes', several default figures may be generated, depending
# on the configuration of the run. These can be: a comparison of the different
# optimisation configurations, a comparison of the different optimisation
# configurations with the USO, or a comparison of the Farquhar and Collatz
# photosynthesis models.

plot = None


## 6. Assigning the model run to a specific project

# When no project name is specified, all input and output files are stored
# directly in the input & output repositories. Otherwise, input and output files
# are stored in folders named after the project, i.e., input/project1/ and
# output/project1/.

project = None
